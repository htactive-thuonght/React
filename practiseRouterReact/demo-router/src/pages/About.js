      <h2>My Hometown</h2>
      <span>
        My hometown is Quang Binh. Quang Binh is a province in the west of Viet
        Nam. There is a lot of tourism here. Quang Binh is a great place. I
        really like it because it is a place where I was born. This is a
        friendly and beautiful place. There are many mountains here. For
        tourists, there are a lot of caves sush as Phong Nha, Thien Duong, Son
        Doong, etc. Here, there are many local specialties, for example: soup,
        sizziling cake, khoai deo, ect. Beside, the scenery here is very
        romantic and pretty. My favorite places are the beach and the mountains.
        I often go to Da Nhay and Nhat Le beach with my family. I am feeling
        comfortable and funny when I go to there. My hometown is very developed.
        Now, it has got many company, apartment and attracting many tourists. .
        It's 200 kilometres from Da Nang city.

      <span>
        Every people has also a childhooh though it's sad or happy. For me,
        sometimes I want to come back to my childhooh to live whith my happy
        memories. To day, I am going talk about my first day at school. My
        mother accompanied me to school on the first day. Other parents
        accompanied their children as well. I and my mother met my friend. Her
        father accompanied her to school. I felt happy and fun when I met and
        talked with her. Then we went to school yard and waited in front of the
        school office. Soon a teacher came and led us to some classrooms. There
        we were put into 2 separate classes. I cried because my mother didn't
        allowed into the classroom. My teacher managed to coax me to stop
        crying. Then, I didn'n cry and played together. Finally the bell rang
        for us to go home. Then, I came back home with my friends. It had been a
        wonderful first day at school and I will never forget it.

      <span>
        Today, I am going to talk about my sister. Her name is Hanh, she is 28
        years old. She is a teacher. She has got long black hair and oval eyes.
        She has got thin eyebrows and long nose. She has got round mouth and
        slim. I and she often go to church and go to the cinema. She always help
        to everyone, so I think, she is very friendly and caring people. In my
        family, she ususlly do housework, she cleans the floor and cooks for my
        family so she never complains anythings. So, I think she is very careful
        and tolerant. She always helps me do homework and also gives me
        homework. She is a my friend, who always shares and gives me a feeling
        of comfort and safe. But she is very intolerant person when I talk her
        boyfriend. She is quite serious when she is working, she don't like
        other bother and noisy. My parents always compare me and her. Because, I
        am a naughty girl, but she is very gentle. I really love her.
